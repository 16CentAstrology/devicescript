# DeviceScript VSCode Extension

## Development

* run VSCode
* in debug pane, run the 'VSCode Extension' configuration
* go to Extension VSCode
* run `jacdac devtools`
* run "DeviceScript: Debug File" command (extension is only activated when you run some command!)
* switch to Debug Console in the main VSCode - you should see some output from jacdac-ts there
