-   DeviceScript simulator
-   Sensor and Jacdac simulator
-   Connection to native DeviceScript device
-   Device, services, register Explorer view
-   Register and Event watch

## Installation

:::note

The extension is not yet available from the marketplace and needs to be installed manually from the GitHub releases page.

:::

-   find the latest `devicescript-vscode-*` release at [https://github.com/microsoft/devicescript/releases](https://github.com/microsoft/devicescript/releases?q=devicescript-vscode&expanded=true)
-   download `devicescript.vsix` from **Assets**
-   install the .vsix file in code (see [full instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace#_install-from-a-vsix))

Using the **Install from VSIX** command in the Extensions view command dropdown,
or the **Extensions: Install from VSIX** command in the Command Palette, point to the .vsix file.

## Setting up the project

The extension activates lazily when it detects a DeviceScript,
so let's use a terminal to create the initial project structure.

-   Open a terminal (`` Ctrl + ` ``)
-   Create a new folder if needed

```bash
mkdir mydevice
cd mydevice
```

-   Use the `init` command to setup a new project

```bash
npx @devicescript/cli@latest init
yarn install
```

The extension should now be loaded. Go to the debug section and start debugging!

## DeviceScript basics

Navigate to the [Developer section](/developer) to learn the basics of the language.

## Troubleshooting {#troubleshooting}

### DeviceScript CLI not installed

The developement server runs the DeviceScript command line (`@devicescript/cli`) installed
locally in your project.
Make sure `@devicescript/cli` has been
added as a developer dependency to your project, and that dependecies have been installed.

```bash
yarn add -D @devicescript/cli
yarn install
```

### Node.JS won't start

The DeviceScript extension spawns a Node.JS process to
run the debugger adapter, connect to hardware device and build sources.
Depending on your machine configuration, you may have to specify where the Node.JS binaries
are located.

-   Open the **Settings**
-   Search for **DeviceScript node** and update the Node.JS binary path
-   Reload Visual Studio Code

### Local vs Remote Workspaces

Connection to Serial or USB is not supported when working
from a remote workspace, such as GitHub Codespaces.

### Multiple-root workspaces

The extension does not currently handle well workspaces with multiple root folders. It will pick the first one.
