# Other differences with JavaScript

This document lists differences in semantics between DeviceScript and EcmaScript/JavaScript/TypeScript
(referred to as JS in this document).

## Subnormals

DeviceScript doesn't support subnormals, that is numbers is range around -5eâˆ’324 to 5e-324 are rounded to zero
(this includes negative zero).
Subnormals are [not required by the JS specs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/MIN_VALUE).
