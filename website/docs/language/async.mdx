# Async/await and promises

The main difference in semantics between DeviceScript and JavaScript is that DeviceScript programs run in multiple fibers (threads).
In practice, this behaves like JS with `async`/`await` but without an ability to manipulate promises directly
(that is fibers can only interleave at `await` points and at most one fiber runs at any given time).
The compiler enforces usage of `await` where needed.

Technically, the `await` keyword is currently a no-op at runtime.
You can inspect the different currently running fibers in the debugger.
Also stack traces are not cut at `await` points.

You can use `Function.start(...args: any[])` to start a function in a new fiber.
