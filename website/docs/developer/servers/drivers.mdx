# Drivers

Drivers [builtin package](/developer/packages) provides drivers for [I2C peripherals](./i2c)
and [digital gpio](./digital-io).

## Usage

```ts
import { startSHTC3 } from "@devicescript/drivers"

const { temperature, humidity } = await startSHTC3()
```

## What about missing drivers?

So the driver you need isn't here? There are a few options:

-   [Search on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=devicescript) where a community member may have already published a driver.
-   [Create a Driver Request](https://github.com/microsoft/devicescript/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&projects=&template=feature_request.md&title=) to request a new driver. We can't guarantee that we'll have time to implement it, but we maybe someone in the community will!

## Contributing

We welcome contributions for new drivers. Please read our [contributing guide](/CONTRIBUTING.md) to learn more about how to get involved.
