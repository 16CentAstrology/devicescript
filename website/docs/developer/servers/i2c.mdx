# I2C

I2C [builtin package](/developer/builtin-packages) that exposes
a [I2C service](/api/clients/i2c/) to interact with I2C devices.

```ts skip
import { i2c } from "@devicescript/i2c"

const address = 0x..
const register = 0x..
const value = 0x..

// highlight-next-line
await i2c.writeReg(address, register, value)

// highlight-next-line
const readValue = await i2c.readReg(address, register)
```

The [drivers builtin package](/developer/builtin-packages) provides drivers for I2C peripherals.

```ts
import { startSHTC3 } from "@devicescript/drivers"

await startSHTC3()
const t = new ds.Temperature()
const h = new ds.Humidity()
// ...
```
