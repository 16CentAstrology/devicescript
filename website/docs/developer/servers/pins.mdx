# Pins

You can either use hardware GPIO numbers using `gpio()` function, or you can import
a board definition file and use the labels present on the board.

```ts
import { startButton } from "@devicescript/servers"
import { pins } from "@dsboard/adafruit_qt_py_c3"

const buttonA2 = startButton({
    pin: pins.A2,
})
```

The doc-string for `pins.A2` will tell you GPIO number (`1` in this case).
Using named pins is also less error-prone since pins used for internal
functions are not exposed through the `pins` object and the pins that are
exposed are annotated with type (input, output, analog, etc.) which is then
required by the `startSomething()` functions.

The `gpio()` function does not check for pin functions or usage.

```ts
import { gpio } from "@devicescript/core"

// highlight-next-line
const p0 = gpio(0)
```
