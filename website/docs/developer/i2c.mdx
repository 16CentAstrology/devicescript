# I2C

I2C [builtin](/developer/builtin-packages) package that exposes a [I2C service](/api/clients/i2c/) to interact with I2C devices.

-   [I2C service](/api/clients/i2c/)
-   This service can be used directly or used to build [drivers](./drivers).

```ts skip
import { i2c } from "@devicescript/i2c"

const address = 0x..
const register = 0x..
const value = 0x..

// highlight-next-line
await i2c.writeReg(address, register, value)

// highlight-next-line
const readValue = await i2c.readReg(address, register)
```
