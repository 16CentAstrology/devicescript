# Environment

An configuration object pushed from the cloud as an observable. The environment can be configured
throug the gateway OpenAPI or the Visual Studio Code extension.

The environment is cached locally in the settings to handle offline scenarios.

```ts
import { environment } from "@devicescript/cloud"

// highlight-next-line
const env = await environment<{ target: number }>()
```

## value

Reads the current value of the environment.

```ts
import { environment } from "@devicescript/cloud"
const env = await environment<{ target: number }>()

// highlight-next-line
const { target } = await env.read()
```

## subscribe

Subscribes to updates to the environment values.

```ts
import { environment } from "@devicescript/cloud"
const env = await environment<{ target: number }>()

// highlight-next-line
env.subscribe(async ({ target }) => {
    console.log(target)
})
```
