# Packages

DeviceScript uses [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) package manager.
Currently, only TypeScript code can be published - in future we may add [services](custom-services).

To create a DeviceScript library from your project, run `devs add npm`
(or use **DeviceScript: Add npm...** from the command palette in Visual Studio Code).
This will:
- remove the `"private"` field from `package.json`
- add `"devicescript": { "library": true }` (this is required)
- set `"main": "src/index.ts"` (`src/index.ts` is created if missing)
- set `"files"` field
- add `"license"`
- add `"keywords": ["devicescript"]` - keep this so npm search works better!
- add `"author"` and `"repository"` if they can be inferred

All of these can be of course edited in `package.json` afterwards.
In particular it's recommended to name your package `devicescript-something`.

Note that regular DeviceScript applications typically use `src/main.ts` (or `src/mainSomething.ts`)
as the application entry point.
This is typically, **not** the right choice for **library** entry point.
You can keep your `src/main.ts` file as an example or test for the library,
but best to stick to `"main": "src/index.ts"` in `package.json`.
