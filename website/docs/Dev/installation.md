# Installation

DeviceScript has been designed to gradual adoption. From editing scripts online in the docs, to building customized embedded firmware images.
This section will get you started at the level of the stack you're looking for.

## Try DeviceScript

You do not need hardware or install any tools to try out DeviceScript. Try editing this sandbox!

```ts
every(1, () => {
    console.log(`hello`)
})
```

You can edit it directly and press `Run` to load it in the DeviceScript simulator in the documentation.
You can also click on `Fork` and open the sample in CodeSandbox.

## Try DeviceScript locally

Install the [DeviceScript command line](./cli.md) and use your favorite TypeScript IDE to write your scripts.
