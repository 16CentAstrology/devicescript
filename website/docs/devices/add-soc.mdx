# Adding a new System-on-a-Chip or Microcontroller

DeviceScript currently supports the following:

-   [ESP32](https://github.com/microsoft/devicescript-esp32), including the "classic", S2, S3, and C3 variants
-   [RP2040](https://github.com/microsoft/devicescript-pico), including Raspberry Pi Pico and Pico W
-   [WASM and POSIX](https://github.com/microsoft/devicescript/tree/main/runtime/posix) for simulation

Following are work-in-progress:

-   [STM32](https://github.com/microsoft/devicescript-stm32), specifically STM32L475VG

If you're working on a port, let us know (via
[GitHub issue](https://github.com/microsoft/devicescript/issues) or
[discussion](https://github.com/microsoft/devicescript/discussions)) so we can list is here.

Generally, DeviceScript has a concept of an "architecture" which corresponds 1:1 to an executable binary,
which is a specific SoC/MCU or a family thereof
(we use SoC (System-on-a-Chip) and MCU (Microcontroller Unit) interchangably in this document).

For example, for ESP32 there are `esp32`, `esp32c3`, `esp32s2`, and `esp32s3` architectures.
For RP2040, we have two architectures: `rp2040` (generic) and `rp2040w` (with support for WiFi chip from Pico W).
For STM32, it may be possible in future to have say a single `stm32l4` architecture that then dynamically adds enables support
for peripherals that are present and auto-detects the size of RAM and FLASH,
but right now we just have a specific `stm32l475vg`.

DeviceScript further [defines "boards"](/devices/add-board) which take a binary architecture image and binary-edit it to include
configuration data about pin names and on-board peripherals.

Note, that there isn't any shared code for say "ARM" or "RISC-V" architecture, as all the VM code is platform-agnostic C anyways,
which sits in the main [DeviceScript repo](https://github.com/microsoft/devicescript/tree/main/runtime/devicescript).

## Creating new SoC

It's best to start by forking an existing port, we suggest the `rp2040` one, and implement functions one by one.
Start by looking at `jd_user_config.h` file and disable things.

Also, make sure your SoC [has enough memory](/language/runtime#memory).
